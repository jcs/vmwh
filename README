vmwh is a vmware userland (x11) helper, developed on openbsd to run alongside
the vmt(4) vmware kernel driver, though it does not need the kernel driver for
anything so it may work on other operating systems.  it is developed on amd64,
though there is i386 assembly code (taken from vmt(4)) which should work the
same.


current features

 - detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the host ("ungrabs") and
   sends the guest's x11 cursor coordinates.

 - detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the guest ("grabs") and
   warps the x11 cursor to the host mouse's coordinates.


still in development

 - clipboard synchronization, which will send the clipboard contents back and
   forth on the grab/ungrab events.
