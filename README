vmwh is a vmware userland (x11) helper, developed on openbsd to run alongside
the vmt(4) vmware kernel driver, though it does not need the kernel driver for
anything so it may work on other operating systems.  it is developed on amd64,
though there is i386 assembly code (taken from vmt(4)) which should work the
same.

it currently detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the host
("ungrabs") and sends the guest's x11 cursor coordinates, which makes vmware
adjust the host cursor to match.  it also sends the x11 clipboard data (read
from xclip) to vmware which gets put onto the host's clipboard.

it then detects when the mouse cursor switches back to the guest ("grabs") and
warps the x11 cursor to the host cursor's last coordinates.  it also reads the
host's clipboard data through vmware and replaces the x11 clipboard buffer with
that data (again using xclip).
